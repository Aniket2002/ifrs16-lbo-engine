%% Theoretical Assumptions for IFRS-16 LBO Framework

\subsection{Assumption A1: Growth Bounds}
Revenue growth rates are bounded: $|g_t| \leq 0.12$ for all $t \in [0,7]$.

\textbf{Justification:} Empirical analysis of LBO deals shows 95\% of annual growth rates fall within $\pm 12\%$ during stable operating periods.

\subsection{Assumption A2: Cash Flow Conversion}
Free cash flow follows: $\text{FCF}_t = (\alpha - \kappa) \text{EBITDA}_t$ with base conversion $\alpha \in [0.6, 0.9]$ and capex drag $\kappa \in [0.1, 0.4]$.

\textbf{Justification:} Standard LBO modeling assumptions consistent with industry practice.

\subsection{Assumption A3: Debt Structure}
Senior debt-to-total debt ratio remains stable at $\rho \in [0.6, 0.8]$ throughout the investment period.

\textbf{Justification:} Covenant requirements typically maintain senior debt seniority structure.

\subsection{Assumption A4: Lease Evolution}
IFRS-16 lease liabilities evolve as: $L_t = L_0(1 + r_L - \delta_L)^t$ with lease rate $r_L \in [0.03, 0.08]$ and decay $\delta_L \in [0.08, 0.15]$.

\textbf{Justification:} Reflects typical lease portfolio maturity profiles and interest rate environment.

\subsection{Assumption A5: Approximation Validity}
The analytic approximations are valid for deals with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Leverage ratios $\leq 7.0x$ at inception
\item Interest coverage ratios $\geq 1.5x$ at inception  
\item Cash sweep rates $s \in [0.25, 0.75]$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Justification:} Covers 90\% of observable LBO transactions in private equity databases.
