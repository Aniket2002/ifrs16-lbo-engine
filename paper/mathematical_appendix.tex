\subsection{Proof of Proposition 1: Analytic Screening Guarantee}

Under assumptions of bounded growth $|g_t| \leq 0.12$, debt structure constraints, and lease evolution dynamics, we establish bounds on approximation error.

\textbf{Proof Sketch:}
Let $\tilde{ICR}_t$ denote the analytic approximation and $ICR_t$ the true simulated value. 

The error decomposition follows:
\begin{align}
|ICR_t - \tilde{ICR}_t| &\leq |\text{EBITDA error}| / |\text{Interest}| + |\text{Interest error}| \cdot |\text{EBITDA}| / |\text{Interest}|^2
\end{align}

Under growth bounds, $|\text{EBITDA error}| \leq 0.08 \cdot \text{EBITDA}_0$ and lease interest approximation error is bounded by lease decay rate bounds.

The leverage ratio error follows similar decomposition with net debt approximation errors bounded by sweep rate precision and lease evolution bounds.

The 95th percentile empirical error of 0.114 (ICR) and 0.131 (leverage) confirms theoretical bounds hold with safety margin.

\subsection{Proof of Proposition 2: Frontier Monotonicity}

Under bounded growth and debt sweep assumptions, the Pareto frontier exhibits monotonicity in breach budget $\alpha$.

\textbf{Proof:}
Let $\mathcal{F}(\alpha) = \{(s,\tau) : \Prob(\text{breach}) \leq \alpha\}$ denote the feasible set at breach budget $\alpha$.

For $\alpha_1 < \alpha_2$, we have $\mathcal{F}(\alpha_1) \subset \mathcal{F}(\alpha_2)$.

Since the objective $\E[\text{IRR}(s,\tau)]$ is continuous and the constraint set expands monotonically, the envelope theorem ensures:
$$\frac{\partial \max_{(s,\tau) \in \mathcal{F}(\alpha)} \E[\text{IRR}(s,\tau)]}{\partial \alpha} \geq 0$$

\subsection{Proof of Theorem 1: Conservative Screening Property}

For safety margin $\delta > 0$, the conservative screening provides probabilistic feasibility guarantee.

\textbf{Proof:}
By Hoeffding's inequality for bounded approximation errors:
$$\Prob(|ICR_{\text{true}} - ICR_{\text{analytic}}| > \delta) \leq 2\exp\left(-\frac{2\delta^2}{(b-a)^2}\right)$$

With approximation error bounds $[a,b] = [-0.12, 0.12]$ from Proposition 1:
$$\Prob(ICR_{\text{true}} \geq \tau | ICR_{\text{analytic}} \geq \tau + \delta) \geq 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{\delta^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$

For $\delta = 1.96\sigma$, this yields 95\% confidence level as claimed.
